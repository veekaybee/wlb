  I&#8217;m Vicki.  Sometimes <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2009/09/28/our-trip-to-israel-the-youtube/">I go to the Dead Sea</a>.Sometimes <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/tag/scotland/" target="_blank">I go to Scotland</a>.

  Usually, I just <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/tag/travel/" target="_blank">like to go</a>.  I was born in Russia. I<a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2009/05/16/the-beginning-of-wisdom-is-to-call-things-by-their-right-names/"> didn&#8217;t have a first name for a month</a>, then I  was named after a breed of strawberry growing on my grandmother&#8217;s dacha in Nizhniy Novgorod, Russia. My full name is Victoria but I hate being called that because I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever grow into it.

  When I was five <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/tag/family/">my parents</a>  decided that Russia was unhealthy for human beings and hightailed it to America.

Growing up, I knew 2.5 other Russian Jews and no one was writing about our experiences. I also didn&#8217;t know anyone else that was as weird as me. So, sometimes I write about being Russian and Jewish. But sometimes I write about feminism, careers, tech, Nutella, running, or what I did yesterday.

I live in the](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2010/09/20/big-changes/) . Me and my nice Russian Jewish husband, [Mr. B](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/tag/mr-b/)  bought [a house](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2011/05/26/pics-from-around-the-house/) last year.

Before Philly, we <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/tag/washington/" target="_blank">used to live in and love Washington, D.C.</a> and I will always bring up why DC is better than Philly.  Before that, Mr. B proposed to me in a synagogue in the [city of Prague](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2009/04/05/mobama-dont-fall-prey-to-the-jew-guilt-in-prague/), which I hated. (Prague, not the synagogue or the proposal.)  Before that, Mr. B&#8217;s family and my family [immigrated from the former Soviet Union](http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2011/01/31/movies-the-vanished-empire/).

In real life, I work with Big Data. I&#8217;m also <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2012/01/08/my-mba-paying-thousands-of-dollars-to-mess-around-with-photoshop/" target="_blank">working on my MBA</a>, which I estimate will take 6 million years. I just <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2012/05/i-basically-just-paid-myself-eight-cents-an-hour-to-learn-that-i-dont-need-an-mba/" target="_blank">self-published my first book</a>. I&#8217;m working <a href="http://blog.vickiboykis.com/2012/06/why-do-i-do-this-to-myself/" target="_blank">on my first novel</a>.
