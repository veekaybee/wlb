I&#8217;m working on a couple of things right now, including finding my computer again (we dismantled it before we painted our office).

But in the meantime: How about we start an open thread on favorite summer activities, since it&#8217;s June 1?

Mine:

  * Bike riding
  * Running
  * Strawberry picking
  * Grilling
  * Shakespeare in the Park.
